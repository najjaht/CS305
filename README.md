# CS305
Artemis Financial is a financial services company that handles sensitive client data. The company's primary concerns were encrypting data in transit, validating data, and identifying vulnerabilities within third-party dependencies. To address these issues, I implemented secure coding practices by configuring HTTPS through a Java Keystore, creating a checksum endpoint that uses SHA-256 for integrity verification, and running an OWASP Dependency-Check scan to detect and remediate vulnerabilities. I also applied layered security through proper configuration, input validation, and dependency management. These efforts ensured the system met financial-industry security expectations and protected the company's clients.
Through this project, I strengthened my ability to identify, analyze, and mitigate software security risks. I learned that coding securely is critical to mainitaining trust, compliance, and long-term stability for any organization. The most challenging part was determining which vulnerabilities were false positives but I eventually was able to familiarize myself with the process. After refactoring the code, I verified the application's functionality and re-scanned for vulnerabilities to confirm no new risks were introduced. I used tools like Java Keytool, OWASP Dependency-Check, and static analysis plugins such as SpotBugs, which I plan to reuse in future projects. From this assignment, I could show future employers my ability to secure a live web service and apply real-world DevSecOps practices to strengthen software reliability.
